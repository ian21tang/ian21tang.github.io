            <p>Hi! My name is Ian, I am 20 years old, and I was born and raised in San Francisco. I love photography, trying new foods, and sleeping in until 1pm. If I wake up before 1pm, I know I am going to have a terrible day.</p>

            <h3>Reading Responses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Something I learned from this article is that more specific language can be used to encourage or inspire the user. An example of this is having "Try London" instead of "Search" in the search bar on the Airbnb app.</li>
                <li>My favorite part of the article was the different GIFs the author made to show the different app home pages deconstructed. It really allowed me to focus and see aspects of the pages that I would previously just gloss over.</li>
                <li>"Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."</li>
                <li>I rate this article a solid 7.5.</li>

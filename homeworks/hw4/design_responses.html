						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that nearly 217 million people live with some form of vision impairment. I was astonished by this number as I didn't realize how many people would have such conditions, and I assume that does not include people who need glasses and such. This huge number is an important wake up call for the necessity of programming for accessibility.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the sample images they provided throughout the article. These sample images helped to elaborate on the points they were trying to make on how to make things more accessible. It helps to show how easy making things accessible can be, and inspires me to incorporate it into my own work. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment." </p>

                            <p> I learned that how you animate different interactions within the UI can change the experience and feel of a website. You can add different animations to try to match the feel of the rest of the app or website you're trying to create. It will also make the app or website feel a lot more immersive and well constructed compared to a bland regularly animated site. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I really liked watching all the GIFs of the different UI interactions and their animations. Each GIF had so many different animations, big and small, that all added together to create a cohesive experience. There were so many cool things taht I had never considered adding to websites or apps. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I really enjoyed looking at the shopping app transitions interaction with the converse shoes. I really enjoy shopping online or on my phone, and seeing how responsive the app and picture of the product was to the different options was really cool. I especially liked how the colors of the Converse shoes changed with the different color selections. I also liked that there was a little circle animation around the selected size or color options, allowing for the user to understand that their option/selection was made and it helped make things more clear. Though this is a cool website, I understand why some shop developers may not go this extra distance as they really just want to sell their product, but I think the extra effort is worth it.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how much the timing of different animations matter even on such a small scale. While I had considered the timing of animations, I did not realize how much of an effect changes at such small scales mattered. I did disagree with some things I learned such as the positioning or animation orders and directions, since I feel like some of that could be applied in artisitc ways which is more subjective. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really enjoyed seeing the animations throughout the article. I liked that the animations were able to easily demonstrate differences in speed for different objects and their animations. I also liked that it showed all the different animation curves and how they looked more natural. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." </p>
						</li>
